\### 🌟 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis



This project is a movie review sentiment analysis tool that classifies text as either "Positive" or "Negative." It uses a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset of 50,000 IMDb movie reviews. The model and the TF-IDF vectorizer are saved to disk, allowing for quick predictions without the need to retrain the model every time the script is run.

&nbsp; \* `main.py`: The core Python script for training, loading, and predicting sentiment.

&nbsp; \* `IMDB Dataset.csv`: The dataset used to train the model.

&nbsp; \* `sentiment\_model.joblib`: The pre-trained Logistic Regression model.

&nbsp; \* `tfidf\_vectorizer.joblib`: The pre-fitted TF-IDF vectorizer.

&nbsp; \* `requirements.txt`: A list of all required Python libraries.

\### 🚀 Getting Started



These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.



\#### \*\*Prerequisites\*\*



You need to have \*\*Python 3.x\*\* installed on your system.



\#### \*\*Installation\*\*



1\.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

&nbsp;   ```

2\.  Navigate to the project directory:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   cd your-repo-name

&nbsp;   ```

3\.  Install the necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   pip install -r requirements.txt

&nbsp;   ```

\### 💻 How to Run



Simply execute the main Python script from your terminal.



```bash

python main.py

```



The script will first check for the pre-trained model files. If they exist, it will load them; otherwise, it will train a new model from the dataset and then save the model files. You will then be prompted to enter a movie review for sentiment prediction.

\### 💡 How It Works



The `main.py` script performs the following key steps:



1\.  \*\*Data Loading and Cleaning\*\*: It loads the `IMDB Dataset.csv` and prepares the text data by converting it to lowercase, removing HTML tags, and punctuation.

2\.  \*\*Training/Loading\*\*: It checks for the `.joblib` model and vectorizer files. If they are found, it loads the pre-trained components. If not, it trains a new \*\*Logistic Regression\*\* model using \*\*TF-IDF features\*\* and saves the model to disk.

3\.  \*\*Prediction\*\*: The `predict\_sentiment` function takes a new review, transforms it using the TF-IDF vectorizer, and uses the model to predict the sentiment.

4\.  \*\*Interactive Interface\*\*: A simple command-line loop allows for continuous sentiment predictions until you type 'exit'.
